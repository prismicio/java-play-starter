## Starter for Play with Java projects

This is a blank [Play framework](http://www.playframework.com) project that will connect to any [prismic.io](https://prismic.io) repository. It uses the prismic.io Java developement kit, and provide a few helpers to integrate with the Play framework.

### How to start?

Edit the `conf/application.conf` file to make the application point to the correct repository:

```
# Prismic.io
# ~~~~~

# API endpoint
prismic.api="https://lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api"

# If specified, this release ref label is used to query the repository
# prismic.ref="St-Patrick specials"

# If specified this token is used for all "guest" requests
# prismic.token="xxx"

# OAuth2 configuration
# prismic.clientId="xxxxxx"
# prismic.clientSecret="xxxxxx"
```

Run your play application using either the `sbt run` command or using activator and open your browser at http://localhost:9000/
